# visualization-asian-hate-crimes-analysis

All .ipynb file should runs in Jupyter notebook. 
The visualization result of each file is at the end of each document or you can simply open the corresponding html file to see the visualization result.

The file "Dash PCA.ipynb" and the file "Interactive Dash Scatter Plot.ipynb" could not export as html since it runs in a dash server.
	To install dash: open the terminal: pip install dash
	To install jupyter-dash: open the terminal: pip install jupyter-dash
	For the two file, just run each block of the code in the documents, and it will gives you a result that saids "Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/";
	Just click on the link, and it will redirect to a new page that shows the visualization result.
